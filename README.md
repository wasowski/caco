Cash Command - personal finance management

Major requirements

* Human readable textual file format (helps to identify data corruptions when it happens)
* Invariants and assertions (help to debug data inconsistencies)
* Modular format -- history should be droppable easily (helps tool performance,
  but also makes editing larger projects in text editor convenient)
